# Challenges and Insights

Working on this project presented several challenges and learning opportunities. Managing both the frontend and backend was initially overwhelming. 
Balancing the two and ensuring they communicated effectively required careful planning. Debugging became more manageable when I tackled issues in smaller, focused chunks.

Setting up the database was a significant learning curve. I initially struggled to understand how to connect MongoDB Atlas with the backend.
By following MongoDB Compass and Atlas tutorials, I successfully set up a database, learned to use it effectively, and ensured secure connectivity.

To keep the project organized, I structured the codebase into separate folders:
- **Frontend**: All React files were placed in a `frontend` folder.
- **Backend**: API logic and server setup files were stored in a `backend` folder.  
Adding comments and maintaining consistent naming conventions improved readability and made collaboration easier.

Balancing frontend and backend development required a methodical approach. Understanding how asynchronous operations work, especially with `async/await`, was tricky at first. 
Gradually, I became comfortable by using Reactâ€™s `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and handle API calls. Logging state changes to the console further simplified debugging.

I also focused on error handling to enhance user experience. On the backend, I sent descriptive error messages, like `res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid Input' })`.
On the frontend, I displayed user-friendly messages such as *"Something went wrong. Please try again later."* These small additions greatly improved the overall application quality and made debugging faster.

Overall, this project was both challenging and rewarding. It taught me how to manage full-stack development, debug complex issues, and deploy applications in a real-world scenario.
Despite the initial difficulties, breaking down problems into smaller parts, experimenting with solutions, and learning from mistakes helped me overcome obstacles and complet
